// The files here in the routes folder are used to route a user's request
// to the destination we've chosen. To better understand this, consider
// this example:
// Imagine we had an app which allowed users to browse fruits. A plan which
// makes sense would be to have the URLs look like project.com/fruits/apple.
// To do this, we would make a file here in the routes folder called fuits.js,
// which would have router.get's for each fruit which exists. Meanwhile, in
// start.js we would create an app.get for fruits, using a require(routes/fruits)
// statement. This can be somewhat confusing, but we'll go over it until we're
// all on the same page.
